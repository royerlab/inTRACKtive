# Contributing

Thank you for wanting to contribute! Here is information on making pull requests, reporting bugs, and licensing.

## Proposing changes
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes by running `npm run validate`.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Reporting bugs
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/axe-storybook-testing/issues/new). It's that easy!

## Lincensing
When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.
